/**
 * # CategorySDLMixer
 *
 * SDL_mixer is a library to make complicated audio processing tasks easier.
 *
 * It offers audio file decoding, mixing multiple sounds together, basic 3D
 * positional audio, and various audio effects.
 *
 * It can mix sound to multiple audio devices in real time, or generate mixed
 * audio data to a memory buffer for any other use. It can do both at the same
 * time!
 *
 * To use the library, first call MIX_Init(). Then create a mixer with
 * MIX_CreateMixerDevice() (or MIX_CreateMixer() to render to memory).
 *
 * Once you have a mixer, you can load sound data with MIX_LoadAudio(),
 * MIX_LoadAudio_IO(), or MIX_LoadAudioWithProperties(). Data gets loaded once
 * and can be played over and over.
 *
 * When loading audio, SDL_mixer can parse out several metadata tag formats,
 * such as ID3 and APE tags, and exposes this information through the
 * MIX_GetAudioProperties() function.
 *
 * To play audio, you create a track with MIX_CreateTrack(). You need one
 * track for each sound that will be played simultaneously; think of tracks as
 * individual sliders on a mixer board. You might have loaded hundreds of
 * audio files, but you probably only have a handful of tracks that you assign
 * those loaded files to when they are ready to play, and reuse those tracks
 * with different audio later. Tracks take their input from a MIX_Audio
 * (static data to be played multiple times) or an SDL_AudioStream (streaming
 * PCM audio the app supplies, possibly as needed). A third option is to
 * supply an SDL_IOStream, to load and decode on the fly, which might be more
 * efficient for background music that is only used once, etc.
 *
 * Assign input to a MIX_Track with MIX_SetTrackAudio(),
 * MIX_SetTrackAudioStream(), or MIX_SetTrackIOStream().
 *
 * Once a track has an input, start it playing with MIX_PlayTrack(). There are
 * many options to this function to dictate mixing features: looping, fades,
 * etc.
 *
 * Tracks can be tagged with arbitrary strings, like "music" or "ingame" or
 * "ui". These tags can be used to start, stop, and pause a selection of
 * tracks at the same moment.
 *
 * All significant portions of the mixing pipeline have callbacks, so that an
 * app can hook in to the appropriate locations to examine or modify audio
 * data as it passes through the mixer: a "raw" callback for raw PCM data
 * decoded from an audio file without any modifications, a "cooked" callback
 * for that same data after all transformations (fade, positioning, etc) have
 * been processed, a "stopped" callback for when the track finishes mixing, a
 * "postmix" callback for the final mixed audio about to be sent to the audio
 * hardware to play. Additionally, you can use MIX_Group objects to mix a
 * subset of playing tracks and access the data before it is mixed in with
 * other tracks. All of this is optional, but allows for powerful access and
 * control of the mixing process.
 *
 * SDL_mixer can also be used for decoding audio files without actually
 * rendering a mix. This is done with MIX_AudioDecoder. Even though SDL_mixer
 * handles decoding transparently when used as the audio engine for an app,
 * and probably won't need this interface in that normal scenario, this can be
 * useful when using a different audio library to access many file formats.
 *
 * This library offers several features on top of mixing sounds together: a
 * track can have its own gain, to adjust its volume, in addition to a master
 * gain applied as well. One can set the "frequency ratio" of a track, to
 * speed it up or slow it down, which also adjusts its pitch. A channel map
 * can also be applied per-track, to change what speaker a given channel of
 * audio is output to.
 *
 * Almost all timing in SDL_mixer is in _sample frames_. Stereo PCM audio data
 * in Sint16 format takes 4 bytes per sample frame (2 bytes per sample times 2
 * channels), for example. This allows everything in SDL_mixer to run at
 * sample-perfect accuracy, and it lets it run without concern for wall clock
 * time--you can produce audio faster than real-time, if desired. The problem,
 * though, is different pieces of audio at different _sample rates_ will
 * produce a different number of sample frames for the same length of time. To
 * deal with this, conversion routines are offered: MIX_TrackMSToFrames(),
 * MIX_TrackFramesToMS(), etc. Functions that operate on multiple tracks at
 * once will deal with time in milliseconds, so it can do these conversions
 * internally; be sure to read the documentation for these small quirks!
 *
 * SDL_mixer offers basic positional audio: a simple 3D positioning API
 * through MIX_SetTrack3DPosition() and MIX_SetTrackStereo(). The former will
 * do simple distance attenuation and spatialization--on a stereo setup, you
 * will hear sounds move from left to right--and on a surround-sound
 * configuration, individual tracks can move around the user. The latter,
 * MIX_SetTrackStereo(), will force a sound to the Front Left and Front Right
 * speakers and let the app pan it left and right as desired. Either effect
 * can be useful for different situations. SDL_mixer is not meant to be a full
 * 3D audio engine, but rather Good Enough for many purposes; if something
 * more powerful in terms of 3D audio is needed, consider a proper 3D library
 * like OpenAL.

 * - `MIX_PROP_METADATA_TOTAL_TRACKS_NUMBER`: the total tracks on the album
 *   (13)
 * - `MIX_PROP_METADATA_YEAR_NUMBER`: the year the audio was released (1991)
 * - `MIX_PROP_METADATA_DURATION_FRAMES_NUMBER`: The sample frames worth of

/* operations that deal with actual mixing/playback... */

/**
 * Start (or restart) mixing a track for playback.
 *
 * The track will use whatever input was last assigned to it when playing; an
 * input must be assigned to this track or this function will fail. Inputs are
 * assigned with calls to MIX_SetTrackAudio(), MIX_SetTrackAudioStream(), or
 * MIX_SetTrackIOStream().
 *
 * If the track is already playing, or paused, this will restart the track
 * with the newly-specified parameters.
 *
 * As there are several parameters, and more may be added in the future, they
 * are specified with an SDL_PropertiesID. The parameters have reasonable
 * defaults, and specifying a 0 for `options` will choose defaults for
 * everything.
 *
 * These are the supported properties:
 *
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOPS_NUMBER`: The number of times to loop the track when
 *   it reaches the end. A value of 1 will loop to the start one time. Zero
 *   will not loop at all. A value of -1 requests infinite loops. If the input
 *   is not seekable and this value isn't zero, this function will report
 *   success but the track will stop at the point it should loop. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_MAX_FRAME_NUMBER`: Mix at most to this sample frame
 *   position in the track. This will be treated as if the input reach EOF at
 *   this point in the audio file. If -1, mix all available audio without a
 *   limit. Default -1.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_MAX_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_MAX_FRAME_NUMBER property, but the value is specified in
 *   milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties are specified,
 *   the sample frames value is favored. Default -1.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_FRAME_NUMBER`: Start mixing from this sample frame
 *   position in the track's input. A value <= 0 will begin from the start of
 *   the track's input. If the input is not seekable and this value is > 0,
 *   this function will report failure. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_MILLISECOND_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_FRAME_NUMBER property, but the value is specified in
 *   milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties are specified,
 *   the sample frames value is favored. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_FRAME_NUMBER`: If the track is looping, this is
 *   the sample frame position that the track will loop back to; this lets one
 *   play an intro at the start of a track on the first iteration, but have a
 *   loop point somewhere in the middle thereafter. A value <= 0 will begin
 *   the loop from the start of the track's input. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_MILLISECOND_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_FRAME_NUMBER property, but the value is
 *   specified in milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties
 *   are specified, the sample frames value is favored. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_FRAMES_NUMBER`: The number of sample frames over
 *   which to fade in the newly-started track. The track will begin mixing
 *   silence and reach full volume smoothly over this many sample frames. If
 *   the track loops before the fade-in is complete, it will continue to fade
 *   correctly from the loop point. A value <= 0 will disable fade-in, so the
 *   track starts mixing at full volume. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_FRAMES_NUMBER property, but the value is specified
 *   in milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties are
 *   specified, the sample frames value is favored. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_FRAMES_NUMBER`: At the end of mixing this
 *   track, after all loops are complete, append this many sample frames of
 *   silence as if it were part of the audio file. This allows for apps to
 *   implement effects in callbacks, like reverb, that need to generate
 *   samples past the end of the stream's audio, or perhaps introduce a delay
 *   before starting a new sound on the track without having to manage it
 *   directly. A value <= 0 generates no silence before stopping the track.
 *   Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_FRAMES_NUMBER property, but the value is
 *   specified in milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties
 *   are specified, the sample frames value is favored. Default 0.
 *
 * If this function fails, mixing of this track will not start (or restart, if
 * it was already started).
 *

/**

 *
 * The mixer will mix as quickly as possible; since it works in sample frames
 * instead of time, it can potentially generate enormous amounts of audio in a
 * small amount of time.
 *
 * On success, this always fills `buffer` with `buflen` bytes of audio; if all
 * playing tracks finish mixing, it will fill the remaining buffer with
 * silence.
 *
 * Each call to this function will pick up where it left off, playing tracks
 * will continue to mix from the point the previous call completed, etc. The
 * mixer state can be changed between each call in any way desired: tracks can
 * be added, played, stopped, changed, removed, etc. Effectively this function
 * does the same thing SDL_mixer does internally when the audio device needs
 * more audio to play.

 * This function can not be used with mixers from MIX_CreateMixerDevice();
 * those generate audio as needed internally.
